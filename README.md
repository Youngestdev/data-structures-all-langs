# Data-structures-all-langs
A repository that contains explanations and (custom) implementations of the most popular data structures in various languages.

# The Goal
Hi friend, welcome ðŸŽ‰.

This simple goal of this project is to help people understand the internals of the most popular data structures. It is my hope that by reading the READMEs for each data structure as well as looking through various implementations, the people who make the time to visit this repo will gain an intuitive understanding.

## Exploring The Project
This project wasn't written as a deployable service. To explore the project:
* Clone the repo (or fork it so that you can update easily)
* Study the READMEs and the implementations for the data structure you want to know more about in the language(s) of your choice
* Try running the code in each coding file using the driver code. If an implementation doesn't have any driver code, please create an issue
* Enjoy your life
