## Introduction
Introduce the data structure here. List the operations that will be considered.

## Internals
Small description to explain what this section entails for the data structure in question.

### Structure 1 as underlying data structure

#### Operations
1. **`firstOperation()`**
    ```
    Pseudocode:
    Step 1
    Step 2
    Step 3
    ```

    **Time Complexity** : Small description of what is involved
    | Sample operation       | Worst Case for `firstOperation()`  |
    |------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | Constant Time/O(1)     | Constant Time/O(1)                 |

    **Space Complexity** : Small description of what is involved
    | Sample operation       | Worst Case for `firstOperation()`  |
    |------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | Constant Space/O(1)    | Constant Space/O(1)                |

2. **`secondOperation()`**
    ```
    Pseudocode:
    Step 1
